# Flatiron Survival App
Application for students of Flatiron School to assist with their tenure at school.

# Motivation
In my tenure at Flatiron School, I saw a need for a companion application that helps with commutes, referrals for mealplans around the area, and various other ideas that I thought would be helpful. With that in mind, I went out and built the application as our first javascript project.
